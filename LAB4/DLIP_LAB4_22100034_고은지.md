## **Introduction**

 Recently, there are a lot of application of image processing and deep learning on manual works. In this lab, we can look for the system that detects the number of cars and available parking space. Throgh this work, we can manage the parking lot automatically, and make it easier to get the information of parking lot. 

There are two functions in this parking managemnet system which are counting the number of vehicles in the parking lot and displaying the number of available parking spaces. 

To conduct this sytem, Image processing and yolo deep learning model was applied. According to the two functions in the system, there are two parts. First, with the image processing and yolov8 pre-trained model, we can detects the number of cars only in the parking lot. Secondly, we can counts the number of available parking spaces with the image processing. We can get the coordinates of bounding box depending on the result of yolo. With the values and the algorithm we can counts the number of available parking space.

    - Average x and y about every bounding boxes
    - The number of cars
    - The number of available parking spaces

    - The number of available parking spaces
- Variable that we have to initialize each frame
    - Parking Available, PA[13]
    - The number of available parking spaces, Count
    - The number of car, Carnum

### Part 1. Cars in the Parking lot

- Pre-Trained yolo model
    
    To detects the cars, we used the yolov8 pre-trained model.
    
    ```python
    model = YOLO('yolov8s.pt')
    ```
    
    With this model, the vehicles in the source video was detected as car, bus and truck. Therefore, we made the algorithm that identifies not only car, but also bus, truck as a car.
    
- Prevent the duplicated cars, IoU
    
    When we use the yolo, there are some issues that the model recognize the same class twice. To prevent the dulplicated bounding box, we made the algorithm that calculates the ‘IoU(Intersection over Union)’ of bounding box and set the threshold value. To save previously drawn bounding boxes and check if new bounding boxes overlap with them, IoU was applied. The area of overlap is ‘intersection’, and we can get it simply to find the area of the rectangle using below equation.
    
    $$
    (maximum value of x-axis - minimum value of x-axis) * (maximum value of y-axis - minimum value of y-axis)
    $$
    
    The area of union is same with below equation.
    
    $$
    𝐴∪𝐵=𝐴+𝐵−𝐴∩𝐵
    $$

    Figure 3. IoU calculation Image
    
    With the concept, the algorithm that counting the number of cars in the parking lot, drawing the bounding box which is not duplicated and title on the frame is same as below code. We will use the number of cars in the main code.
    
    ```python
    # Prevent the Duplicated bbox
    def calculate_iou(box1, box2):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box1
        x3, y3, x4, y4 = box2
    
        xi1 = max(x1, x3)
        yi1 = max(y1, y3)
        xi2 = min(x2, x4)
        yi2 = min(y2, y4)
    
        inter_width = max(0, xi2 - xi1 + 1)
        inter_height = max(0, yi2 - yi1 + 1)
        inter_area = inter_width * inter_height
    
        box1_area = (x2 - x1 + 1) * (y2 - y1 + 1)
        box2_area = (x4 - x3 + 1) * (y4 - y3 + 1)
    
        union_area = box1_area + box2_area - inter_area
    
        iou = inter_area / union_area -10
        return iou
        
    def drawcar(frame, results):
        carnum = 0
        drawn_boxes = []
    
        for result in results:
            for box in result.boxes:
                if (int(box.cls) in [2.0, 5.0, 7.0]):  # 2.0 = car, 5.0 = bus, 7.0 = truck
                    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box.xyxy[0])
    
                    is_duplicate = False
                    for drawn_box in drawn_boxes:
                        iou = calculate_iou((x1, y1, x2, y2), drawn_box)
                        if iou > 0.2:                # if IoU is more than 0.2, duplicated
                            is_duplicate = True
                            break
    
                    if not is_duplicate:
                        carnum += 1
                        cv.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1 + y), (x2, y2 + y), (0, 0, 255), 2)
                        cv.putText(frame, 'car', (x1, y1 + y - 10), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (0, 0, 255), 2)
                        drawn_boxes.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    ```
    

### Part 2. Available Parking Space

- ROI
to detects the cars only in the parking lot, we should see only parking lot space on the frame. The Region of interset in same as below.

```
# Define ROI coordinates and size
x, y, width, height = 0, 240, 1280, 180
```

- Parking Lot Points in the Frame
    
    There are 13 parking spaces in the source video, and to determine whether that car is located in the parking lot, the points of the parking lot is required. If the center of bounding box of car is located in the each parking lot, then the parking lot is considerd as unavailable parking space.
    
    Therefore, the points of parking lot is same as below, and all the points were obtained by drawing lines on the picture.
    
    ```python
    # Parking Points, PP
    PP = np.zeros((13, 4))
    
    PP[:, 1] = 320
    PP[:, 3] = 430
    
    initial_values = [
        [60, 160],
        [160, 260],
        [260, 360],
        [360, 455],
        [455, 547],
        [547, 635],
        [635, 725],
        [725, 815],
        [815, 905],
        [905, 995],
        [995, 1090],
        [1090, 1190],
        [1190, 1280]
    ]
    
    for i, (val1, val2) in enumerate(initial_values):
        PP[i, 0] = val1
        PP[i, 2] = val2
    ```
    
- Center of Bounding Box
    
    First, there are two arrays. One is PP[13][4], wich has the information of all parking lot coordinates, and the other one is PA[13], which has information of each parking lot is occupied with car or not. If it’s occupied, PA[i] == 1, and if not, PA[i] == 0.
    
    If the yolo model detects the object as a car, and it passed the duplication test, then we will calculate the center of bounding box, and check if the bounding box is located in the 13 parking lot. As the checking algorithm, each frame will returns the PA array.
    
    ```python
    def ParkingSpace(results, PP):
        PA = [0] * 13
        for result in results:
            for box in result.boxes:
                x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box.xyxy[0])
                x_avg = (x1 + x2) / 2
                y_avg = (y1 + y + y2 + y) / 2
                for i in range(13):
                    if x_avg > PP[i][0] and x_avg < PP[i][2] and y_avg > PP[i][1] and y_avg < PP[i][3]:
                        PA[i] = 1
        return PA
    ```
    
- Parking Space Algorithm
    
    With the ‘drawcar’ function, we can get the number of cars in the parking lot, and with the ‘ParkingSpace’ function, we can get the available parking spaces each frame. In the main code, we can counts the number of available parking space, prints the results of the number of cars and available parking spaces on the frame, and make the text file that contains the number of frame and the number of cars.
    
    ```python
    frame_number = 0
    carnum = drawcar(frame, results)
    PA = ParkingSpace(results, PP)
    for i in range(13):
    	if PA[i] == 0:
    		count += 1
     # Print count & carnum
     cv.putText(frame, f'Available Parking: {count}', (900, 50), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
     cv.putText(frame, f'Number of Car: {carnum}', (900, 100), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    
    # save the frame number and count to text file
    f.write(f'{frame_number},{count}\n')
    
    frame_number += 1
    ```
    

## **Results and Analysis**

### Results

When the yolo pre-trained model detects all the cars, the number of cars and the available parking spaces was detected well on the ROI section. 

![Resultpng](https://github.com/eunjijuliako/DLIP/assets/164735460/dc7f4305-81e4-4c30-8cc0-b0b51bbd1327)

Figure 4. Result

### Analysis

- Accuracy

$$
Accuracy = (TN+TP)/ALL
$$

With the true data of frame number and the number of available parking spaces, we can calculate the accuracy. As a result, the accuracy of this algoritm is 93%.

### Conclusion

As a conclusion, we could detect the number of cars in the parking lot and the numbe of available parking spaces. 

In the process, we could learn how to prevent the dulplication of bounding box with the concept of IoU. Also, we coulde apply the yoloyv8 pre-trained model to detect the cars.

As a result, the number of cars and available parking spaces were detected well mostly, but there are some frames that the parking spaces was detected as a car. 

To improve this classification problems, we can make a custom yolo model that trained with the source video webcam data. To make the model, we should get the data of the parking lot with various circumstances.
