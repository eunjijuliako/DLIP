# Introduction

## Background and Problem Statement

 This final project aims to implement a purposeful algorithm with images using deep learning and image processing. Through this project, we wanted to know how to use image processing as a medical technology for medical diagnosis and analysis. Therefore, we focused on breast cancer problems and deep-learning CNN models.
First, breast cancer in Korea is the most common cancer among women, and the number of breast cancer patients has more than doubled over the past decade. It is among the highest incidence groups among Asian countries. Therefore, the importance of diagnosing and treating breast cancer is increasing. Second, many kinds of CNN models exist, but studies on which models are suitable for medical imaging are needed.

## CNN Models

 The CNN model, short for Convolutional Neural Network, is used when there is a large amount of complex data such as image data because operations are repeated for hundreds of layers. The CNN model can visually detect the presence or absence of cancer cells in images by reviewing thousands of data or can be used in audio processing, object detection, synthetic data generation, and various fields. To this end, a pre-trained model built by learning and testing a new model is used. We used three kinds of CNN models in this project.

### Yolo

: You Look Only Once

 YOLOv8 provides the latest performance in terms of accuracy and speed when detecting and segmenting objects. With one stage detection method, YOLO can detect objects in real-time by simultaneously performing classification and localization. There are few background errors because it learns the surrounding information and processes the entire image. As its name implies, the entire image is viewed only once. This means that it does not do the work of analyzing multiple images by dividing them into multiple sheets like the R-CNN-based method.

**Architecture**

![1 Yolo](https://github.com/eunjijuliako/DLIP/assets/164735460/3f9f5678-3daa-4e63-8c24-07558d60f231)

Figure 1. Yolo architecture

- Resizes the input image into 448x448 before going through the convolutional network.
- A 1x1 convolution is first applied to reduce the number of channels, followed by a 3x3 convolution to generate a cuboidal output.
- The activation function under the hood is ReLU, except for the final layer, which uses a linear activation function.
- Some additional techniques, such as batch normalization and dropout, respectively regularize the model and prevent it from overfitting.

### UNet

 U-Net is a structure proposed in the paper 'U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation', showing accurate image segmentation performance with very few training data, and won the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge when 2015 by a large margin.

**Architecture**

- Overlap-tile strategy & Mirroring Extrapolation
    
    It is a better method than zero padding for medical data such as cells that do not significantly affect left and right symmetries because it can give the effect of data augmentation while mirror extrapolation.
    
- Data Augmentation
    
    Elastic Deformation is a way of transforming pixels to randomly twist in different directions. If you look at the figure above, you can see that even elastic deformation transforms to be as real as it is in the real world. The authors used these techniques to increase data in the article.
    

### FCN

: Fully Connected Networks for Semantic Segmentation

 FCN is a model modified to perform semantic segmentation tasks using existing networks AlexNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet whose performance has been verified in segmentation. In the existing network structure, a fully connected layer is inserted at the end, and in order to use this FCL, only a fixed size of input must be received, and after passing the FCL, location information disappears. It is not suitable for image segmentation because segmentation requires location information (where an object exists). To overcome the disadvantages, FCN was created to replace the last FCL of the model used in segmentation with a convolution layer. When FCN is used, location information or class information is not lost and input size is not limited.

**Architecture**

2. Change the number of channels in the Feature Map to equal the number of clades in the dataset using the 1x1 convolution layer
3. Upsampling a low-resolution Heat Map using Transposed Convolution, and creating a Map of the same size as the input image
4. Color according to each Pixel class in the Map and return the result

2. **Create or load the model**
    - Yolo
        
        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO
        model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')
        ```
        
    
    We used the segmentation version 8n provided by Ultralytics for the Yolo model. 
    
    - UNet
        
        ```python
        def unet_model(input_size=(128, 128, 3)):
            inputs = Input(input_size)
        
            # Contracting path
            conv1 = Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
            conv1 = Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv1)
            pool1 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv1)
        
            conv2 = Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(pool1)
            conv2 = Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv2)
            pool2 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv2)
        
            conv3 = Conv2D(256, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(pool2)
            conv3 = Conv2D(256, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv3)
            pool3 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv3)
        
            conv4 = Conv2D(512, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(pool3)
            conv4 = Conv2D(512, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv4)
            pool4 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv4)
        
            conv5 = Conv2D(1024, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(pool4)
            conv5 = Conv2D(1024, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv5)
        
            # Expansive path
            up6 = concatenate([UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(conv5), conv4], axis=-1)
            conv6 = Conv2D(512, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(up6)
            conv6 = Conv2D(512, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv6)
        
            up7 = concatenate([UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(conv6), conv3], axis=-1)
            conv7 = Conv2D(256, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(up7)
            conv7 = Conv2D(256, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv7)
        
            up8 = concatenate([UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(conv7), conv2], axis=-1)
            conv8 = Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(up8)
            conv8 = Conv2D(128, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv8)
        
            up9 = concatenate([UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(conv8), conv1], axis=-1)
            conv9 = Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(up9)
            conv9 = Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(conv9)
        
            conv10 = Conv2D(1, 1, activation='sigmoid')(conv9)
        
            model = Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[conv10])
        
            model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        
            return model
            
         model = unet_model(input_size=(image_size[0], image_size[1], 3))
        ```
        
    
    The UNet model was built by directly writing the architecture. 
    
    - FCN
        
        ```python
        import torch
        import torchvision.transforms as transforms
        
        device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
        model = models.segmentation.fcn_resnet50(pretrained=True)  # Using FCN ResNet50 model
        model.classifier[4] = torch.nn.Conv2d(512, 3, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))  # Adjust for binary segmentation
        model = model.to(device)
        ```
        

For the FCN model, we used the segmentation model provided by Pytorch. We changed the depth of convolution 1 to 3.

1. **Prepare the dataset depends on the CNN model**
    - Yolo
        
        ```python
        train: 'Datasets/images/training'
        val: 'Datasets/images/validation'
        train: 'Datasets/masks/training'
        val: 'Datasets/masks/validation'
        ```
        
    
    - UNet
        
        ```python
        image_path = 'Datasets/images'
        mask_path = 'Datasets/masks'
        ```
        
    
    - FCN
        
        ```python
        image_path = 'Datasets/images' 
        mask_path = 'Datasets/masks' 
        ```
        

The data was split into training and validation sets with a ratio of 8:2. Then, Yolo was set up with the following folder configuration. UNet was trained using the entire image. Similarly, FCN also used the entire image for training. Test images were selected randomly, using 20% of the data.

### 2. Training

1. **Train with the dataset** 
    - Yolo
    
    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    
    def train():
        # Load a pretrained YOLO model
        model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')
    
        # Train the model using the 'maskdataset.yaml' dataset for 3 epochs
        results = model.train(data='Yolo_segmentation.yaml', epochs=12, task='segment')
        
    if __name__ == '__main__':  
        train()
    ```
    
    - UNet
    
    ```python
    # Path
    image_path = 'Datasets/images'
    mask_path = 'Datasets/masks'
    image_size = (128, 128)
    
    # Load Images
    X, y = load_images(image_path, mask_path, image_size)
    
    # Create model
    model = unet_model(input_size=(image_size[0], image_size[1], 3))
    
    # Callback
    checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('unet.keras', monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True)
    early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, verbose=1)
    
    # Train
    history = model.fit(X, y, validation_split=0.1, epochs=50, batch_size=16, callbacks=[checkpoint, early_stopping])
    
    # Save
    model.save('unet_final.keras')
    
    ```
    
    - FCN
    
    ```python
    # Training Function
    def train_model(model, dataloader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=12):
        model.train()
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            running_loss = 0.0
            for images, labels in dataloader:
                images = images.to(device)
                labels = labels.to(device)
    
                # Forward pass
                outputs = model(images)['out']
                labels = labels.float()
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    
                # Backward pass
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
    
                running_loss += loss.item() * images.size(0)
    
            epoch_loss = running_loss / len(dataloader.dataset)
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {epoch_loss:.4f}")
    
    # Training the Model
    num_epochs = 12
    train_model(model, train_dataloader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs)
    print("Done!")
    
    ```
    

The models mentioned above were trained using 12 epochs in common. For Yolo, the trained model was saved as a â.ptâ file. The UNet model was saved as a â.kerasâ file. Finally, the FCN model was saved as a â.pthâ file.

### 3. Post-processing

```python
def determine_class(mask):
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    if len(contours) == 0:
        return 1, 0  # normal (no mask detected)
    
    contour = contours[0]
    
    perimeter = cv2.arcLength(contour, True)
    area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
    if perimeter == 0:
        return 1, 0  # normal (no valid contour)
    
    circularity = 4 * np.pi * (area / (perimeter * perimeter))
    if circularity > 0.8:
        return 2, area  # benign (round mask)
    
    else:
        return 3, area  # malignant (irregular mask)

# Class info
class_info = {
    1: {'color': (0, 1, 0), 'name': 'normal'},      # normal (green)
    2: {'color': (1, 1, 0), 'name': 'benign'},      # benign (yellow)
    3: {'color': (1, 0, 0), 'name': 'malignant'}    # malignant (red)
}

def visualize_results(images, model):
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(12, 12))

    for i, (image, _, img_name) in enumerate(images):
        row, col = divmod(i, 3)
        # Original image
        original_image = TF.to_pil_image(image)

        # Prediction
        with torch.no_grad():
            model_output = model(image.unsqueeze(0).to(device))['out']
            predicted_mask = torch.sigmoid(model_output)[0][0]  # Assuming binary output
            predicted_mask = (predicted_mask > 0.5).cpu().numpy().astype(np.uint8) * 255

        # Determine class and area
        class_id, area = determine_class(predicted_mask)
        color = class_info[class_id]['color']
        class_name = class_info[class_id]['name']

        # Determine stage for malignant class
        if class_id == 3:
            if area < 100:
                stage = '1'
            elif 100 <= area < 200:
                stage = '2'
            elif 200 <= area < 300:
                stage = '3'
            else:
                stage = '4'
            title = f'Class: {class_name}, Stage: {stage}'
        else:
            title = f'Class: {class_name}'

```

 Post-processing was performed to utilize the trained models effectively. The classes were divided into three categories: normal, benign, and malignant. 

Colors were assigned to distinguish each class. Additionally, the classes were differentiated based on the shape of the detected mask. If there was no mask, it was classified as normal. 

If the mask was close to a circle, it was classified as benign. If the mask had a jagged shape, it was classified as malignant. 

Further post-processing was performed for those classified as malignant. The stages were divided based on size, ranging from 1 to 4 from smallest to largest. This allows for the diagnosis of cancer and the classification of cancer types and progression stages based on characteristics. The Yolo model was used without any post-processing.

 Three evaluation methods were employed accordingly. The first evaluation was binary, determining whether cancer was detected or not. The initial goal was to detect the presence of cancer. This was assessed by determining if the algorithm correctly identified cancer in images where it was present. 

The second evaluation was conducted after post-processing. Since there is no information regarding the stage in the images, this could not be evaluated. Instead, the evaluation was based on classifying the detected cancer into three categories when detected. 

The final evaluation was for segmentation. This was done because we used segmentation models. A good evaluation was given if the similarity to the actual mask size was 70% or more. Segmentation evaluation was deemed the most reliable among the three evaluation methods.

    Figure 8. FCN predicted mask result
    
    |  | Yolov8 | UNet | FCN |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Accuracy | 100% | 70% | 88% |
    | Precision | 100% | 92% | 93% |
    | Recall | 100% | 67% | 91% |
    
     Overall, yolov8 detects well the presence of cancer. FCN performs better at detecting cancer than UNet in the perspective of accuracy, precision, and recall. 
    
    YOLO can outperform UNet or FCN in breast cancer ultrasound imaging because it can capture both regional and global features well with a structure specialized for object detection and an efficient learning method. These features can also be effectively applied in classification tasks.
    
    For classification tasks, a classification-optimized model may be better suited than a segmentation model. Since UNet was originally developed for segmentation, it is possible that FCN specialized for classification tasks performed better. In addition, UNet usually has more parameters and complexity and can cause overfitting problems. If the dataset is not large enough or diverse enough, UNet may overfit and degrade performance in test data.

    | Precision | 100% | 40% | 100% |
    | Recall | 61% | 14% | 52% |
    
    YOLO showed the best performance in breast cancer ultrasound image segmentation because its model structure can perform segmentation by effectively combining the context and regional information of the entire image. FCN also performed well with strong feature extraction capabilities, and UNet was likely to suffer from overfitting problems depending on data characteristics or learning settings, resulting in poor performance. It is important to perform segmentation tasks considering the characteristics of each model and its suitability to the dataset.
    

# Conclusion

**Summary**

 Through this project, we wanted to find out whichÂ of the variousÂ CNN models do well in classification or segmentation when learning ultrasound images of breast cancer. Each of the three models has different ways of classifying andÂ learning data, and they haveÂ been foundÂ through investigations, testing, and analysis.

We expected UNet to show higher accuracy than FCN, but FCN performed better than UNet inÂ bothÂ classification and segmentation. We predicted that there was an overfitting problem in the UNet learning process because we conducted learning and testing with little data.

We carried out this project to help to make a diagnosis with medical pictures. Since this diagnosis result is directly related to life, we paid attention toÂ Precision, which is the valueÂ that isÂ 'true among the predictions of the model'.Â Therefore, whenÂ classification and segmentation were performedÂ among these three models,Â it was concludedÂ that Yolov8, which has the highestÂ precision, was suitable for analyzing ultrasound images of breast cancer.

**Improvement**

 It can be seenÂ that the performance of yolov8 is good, considering that the probability of accuracy and recall of yolov8 as well asÂ precisionÂ is significantly higher than that of other models, but whenÂ segmentationÂ is performed, yolov8 accuracy and recall are 61%, which is not high, so it is necessary to find a CNN model that is more suitable for breast cancer ultrasound images.Â In addition,Â it isÂ necessaryÂ to secureÂ more relevant ultrasound photographic data because the small amount of test data caused overfitting when learning UNet.Â Lastly, to compare and analyze the result of the stage of cancer, we need more accurate data that includes the ground truth of the stage of cancer.
